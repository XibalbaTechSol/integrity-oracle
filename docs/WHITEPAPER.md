# The Integrity Protocol: Whitepaper V3.0
## The Actuarial Standard for the Autonomous Agent Economy

**Author:** Solo Architect, Xibalba Solutions  
**Status:** V3.0 Production Architecture (Dual-Witness / Base L2 / Rust Core)

## 1. Abstract
As autonomous AI agents begin to handle trillions of dollars in global commerce, a systemic "Trust Gap" has emerged. Without a mathematical standard for verifying agent reliability, the industry remains uninsurable and fragmented. The **Integrity Protocol** provides the first decentralized solution: the **Agent Integrity Score (AIS)**. By bridging a high-performance Rust telemetry Oracle with edge-based zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts on Base L2, Xibalba Solutions creates a portable, tamper-proof reputation layer that makes AI agents insurable, trustworthy, and sovereign.

## 2. The Problem: The $1.5T Trust Vacuum
By 2028, over 40% of all online transactions are projected to be initiated by AI agents. Current reputation systems are easily manipulated and lack the technical depth required for institutional risk assessment. 

**Key Failures:**
- **Black-Box Risk:** No way to verify if an agent's internal logic is drifting or compromised.
- **Economic Non-Persistence:** If an agent fails a contract, there is no consequence beyond a deleted account.
- **Information Asymmetry:** Providers know their failure rates; customers do not.
- **Compliance Deficits:** Strict healthcare mandates (such as the Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) AI Third-Party Risk Guide of April 2026) classify unmonitored AI agents as formal HIPAA violations.

## 3. Dual-Witness Architecture
Integrity v3.0 implements a **Dual-Witness Architecture** to solve the throughput constraints of on-chain operations. All heavy telemetry computations and ZK proving are handled off-chain or at the edge, while state commitments and economic enforcement are finalized on-chain.

1.  **Off-Chain Private Witness (The SDK):** Executes inside local enclaves (TEEs) at the edge, generating local **Aztec Noir UltraPlonk Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** proving telemetry correctness without exposing Protected Health Information (PHI) or proprietary IP.
2.  **Real-Time Validator (The Oracle):** A high-throughput Rust-based Axum server for telemetry ingestion and verification via C++ Barretenberg FFI, storing history in the PostgreSQL Trust Vault.
3.  **On-Chain Anchor (The Smart Contracts):** Solidity contracts on Base L2 (`StateAnchor.sol`, `ReputationRegistry.sol`, `UltraPlonkVerifier.sol`) verify ZK proofs and update global reputations.

## 4. The Solution: Tri-Metric AIS
Xibalba Solutions introduces the **Tri-Metric Model**, an actuarial-grade scoring system that evaluates agents across three correlated dimensions:

### 4.1 Pillar 1: Entropy Score (Stability)
Measures the statistical variance of performance. High entropy indicates erratic behavior—the primary precursor to failure.
$$E = e^{-1.5\sigma^2} \times 1000$$

### 4.2 Pillar 2: Grounding Score (Accountability)
Quantifies Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight. Agents with deep human "tethering" are assigned lower risk weights.

### 4.3 Pillar 3: Sacrifice (Compute Proof)
Uses verified GPU/TPU hours as "Proof of Work" to ensure agents have "skin in the game" and prevent low-cost Sybil bot attacks.

## 5. Behavioral Commitment Chain (BCC)
To prevent prompt injection and model drift, agents must cryptographically declare and lock-in their intended action states before mutating database registers or triggering transactions.
- **Declaration:** The agent serializes its proposed action into canonical JSON and signs its SHA-256 hash.
- **Evaluation:** The intent is verified against local **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** rules.
- **Execution:** The receiver validates the signed commitment against actual parameters. Any drift immediately aborts the transaction.

## 6. Dual-Layer Identity: Hierarchy of Accountability
For a reputation score to be actionable, it must be bound to a legal entity. Xibalba enforces an **Identity Ceiling** logic via ERC-8004 registries on Base L2:

- **Tier 1 (Sovereign Agents):** Cryptographically unique but unlinked. Capped at a "CCC" risk rating (AIS 600). Bound to `did:xibalba` hardware identifiers.
- **Tier 2 (Linked Agents):** Bound to a verified digital domain. Capped at "AA" rating (AIS 850).
- **Tier 3 (Institutional Agents):** Fully KYC'd or business-verified. Eligible for the maximum "AAA" rating (AIS 1000). Anchored via `ReputationSBT` (Soulbound Tokens).

---

## 7. The Economy: $ITK Token & Sovereign Tax
The **Integrity Token (ITK)** is the ERC-20 utility asset that fuels the trust engine.
- **The Sovereign Tax:** A dynamic fee (e.g., 0.5%) is applied to reputation-anchored transactions.
- **Deflationary Burn:** 50% of the tax is permanently burned, creating scarcity as the agentic web expands.
- **Staking & Slashing:** Agents must stake ITK to access high-value deals. Misbehavior results in automated collateral slashing to reimburse affected parties.

## 8. HIPAA & Regulatory Compliance
The Integrity Protocol maps directly to HIPAA Technical Safeguards (45 CFR § 164.312):
- **Access Control & Entity Authentication (§ 164.312(a)(1)):** Ensured via hardware-bound DIDs.
- **Audit Controls (§ 164.312(b)):** Handled via `BCCCommitment` envelopes capturing the OPA evaluation logs.
- **Integrity (§ 164.312(c)(1)):** Handled via `AuditShield.sol` and `SovereignAgent.sol` contracts.
- **Transmission Security (§ 164.312(e)(1)):** Handled via local ZK proof generation, ensuring zero PHI leaks.
